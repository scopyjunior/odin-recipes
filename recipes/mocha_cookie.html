    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup white chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon peppermint extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely crushed peppermint candy canes, plus more for decorating</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place white chocolate chips, heavy cream, and 1/8 teaspoon peppermint extract into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at 50% power in 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted and combined. Place mixture, uncovered, in the refrigerator until completely chilled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir espresso powder and hot water together until dissolved.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add in egg and beat until thoroughly combined. Add in espresso mixture, vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract and mix until combined. Pour in half of the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just combinedâ€”dough will be somewhat thick. Stir in chocolate chips and crushed candy canes. Spread dough into the prepared pan in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the bars look just set, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the pan, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chilled white chocolate mixture from the fridge. Whip on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until mixture holds stiff peaks. Spread white chocolate frosting in a thin even layer over the top of the cooled bars and sprinkle with additional crushed candy canes. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
    </ol>
